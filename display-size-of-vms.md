# Display Size of VM’s

## Option 1

The display size of VM’s can be changed from within each individual virtual machine itself. This is done through the normal display settings of each individual OS.

## Option 2

With most VM’s the [VMware Remote Console](https://share.ialab.dsu.edu/IA_Lab/VMware-VMRC-12.0.0-17287072.exe) allow for easier use. This allows you to pop out the VM from the browser.
